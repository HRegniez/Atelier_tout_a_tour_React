# Atelier Tour à Tour

This website was created for a friend's new business. React and Sass were chosen for frontend development to sharpen my skills with these languages.

The backend is in progress, utilizing Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Cloudinary tools may be integrated for managing the gallery efficiently.

#### Frontend

In the frontend, the focus is on enhancing user experience through animations to imbue the site with vitality. Additionally, I aim to develop a user interface to facilitate login functionality for my colleague. This interface will empower them to modify site content and upload images seamlessly.

#### Backend

The backend will utilize Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to manage data efficiently. Additionally, I'm exploring the integration of Cloudinary to handle the image gallery effectively. This setup will ensure robust functionality and scalability for the project.
